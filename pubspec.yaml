  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/bg_lake.jpg
    - images/logo_uit.png
    - images/clap.png
    - images/clap_border.png
    - images/sparkles.png
    - images/ic_home.png
    - images/ic_menu.png
    - images/ic_seat.png
    - images/chair_top.png
    - images/chair_bottom.png
    - images/table_big_pink.png
    - images/table_big_green.png
    - images/table_small_yellow.png
    - images/table_small_green.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
